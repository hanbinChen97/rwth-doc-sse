## Theory

A formal **theory** is syntactic in nature.  
 Thus a theory comes with an underlying **language**  
Modelling languages enable to make models explicit and manageable
- rule defined, e.g. 人不能吃电风扇。
 A theory is an **analytical tool** for understanding, explaining, and making predictions about a given subject matter.

theory


• Mapping feature
 A model is based on an original
• Reduction feature
 A model only reflects a (relevant) selection of the original‘s properties
• Pragmatic feature
 A model needs to (be) usable in place of the original with respect to some purpose

# 04 - Systems Engineering
A system is a set of entities, real or abstract, comprising a whole
Systems Engineering (SysE) is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems.

in the past software was in singele machine.
now human is kind of part of the system.
